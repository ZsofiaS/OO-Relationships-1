## OO Relationships 1 

### Practicals to learn to apply two kinds of OO class relationship:
* Forwarding
* Polymorphism

### Forwarding
Use a forwarding relationship to extract the authentication behaviour from `User` into another class (see `forwarding_exercise.rb`)
Draw a diagram first, then do the refactor on the code.
Refactored code is in `forwarding_exercise_ref.rb`.

To use in the shell: 
```
cd Forwarding exercise
irb
require "./forwarding_exercise_ref.rb"
```
